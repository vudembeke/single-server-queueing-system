# Single-Server Queuing System (M/M/1 Simulation)

This project implements a discrete-event simulation of an M/M/1 single-server queuing system using Python.  
It models customer arrivals and service processes based on exponential probability distributions and evaluates key system performance metrics.  

## Features
- Simulates customer arrivals and service times using exponential random variables.  
- Models queue behavior and server utilization under varying workloads.  
- Calculates performance metrics such as:  
  - Average delay in queue  
  - Average number of customers in queue  
  - Server utilization  
  - Total simulation time  
- Outputs results to an external file (`mm1.out`).  

##  Technologies Used
- Python(Core language)  
- Math & Random Libraries for probability distribution and stochastic modeling  
- File I/O for reading input (`mm1.in`) and writing simulation reports (`mm1.out`)
